Welcome to my new blog about coding, hacking, board games, travel, and assorted nerdery.  For those who want a primer on who I am, [please visit the "about" page](/about).  This site is the new home for my original professional and fun sites, michaelalexander.com.au and beefsack.com respectively.

I look forward to sharing my musing with you all in the near future.
