I'm Michael Alexander, known around the place as [beefsack](https://github.com/beefsack), and I'm a software engineer who spends all his time between [Canberra, Australia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra) and [Guangzhou, China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou).

When I'm not coding for money or for fun, I'll be playing [board games](http://boardgamegeek.com/user/beefsack), playing sport, or chilling with my family and mates.  I also run a nerdy business aimed at hardware hackers called [Miniand](https://www.miniand.com).

For all enquiries, please send email to my handle at Gmail.
